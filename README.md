# AWAS---Thesis-Project
This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based system to classify phytoplankton species from RGB and hyperspectral images. By leveraging CNNs, transfer learning, and multi-modal approaches, the aim is to improve real-time species identification for autonomous marine monitoring.
